# Neural_Network_Architecture_And_Model_Training_And_Evaluation_Assignment
Using Pythong to meet the minimum project requirements for this assignment are as follows:
1) Preprocess the images by normalizing the pixel values to the range [0, 1].
2) Split the dataset into training and validation sets using 'train_test_split()'.
3) Define the neural network architecture by creating a 'Sequential' model and adding layers ('Flatten' and two 'Dense' layers).
4) Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
5) Train the model by calling 'fit()' with the training data and validation data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size.
6) Evaluate the trained model on the test set using 'evaluate()' and print the test loss and accuracy.
